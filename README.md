# Final Project

In this project, you'll build a web application that does anything you want! 

It must meet the project requirements below, but beyond that, feel free to use your creativity to decide on what your app will do.

## Requirements

* Your app has at least three features
  * For a 'Todo list app', three features could be "adding todos", "editing todos", and "removing todos"
* Your project has at least ten commits in git
* Your app is mobile responsive
* Your project contains a `README.md` file that explains what your project is and how to use it
* Your project is hosted on GitHub pages
* Your code is clean
  * Proper indentation
  * No unnecessary repetition
  * Variables as camelCase

## Project ideas

* Travel planner
* Budget manager
* Resume builder
* Ballmer-peak calculator
* Shift scheduling app
* Chat bot
* Music making app
* Games
  * PacMan
  * Chess
* Do something with an external API: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
  * Slack / discord bot
  * Recreate Reddit
  * Pokedex

And so many more possibilities!

## Recommendations

* Start out by creating your project's foundation in HTML.
* From here, build one piece of Javascript functionality at a time, testing each change you make with `console.log`. 
* Frequently make commmits in git to save your progress.
* Keep your code meticulously organized as you go. Use proper indentation, whitespace, and comments for organization. Additionally, write functions for each separate piece of functionality that exists in your code. This make your code "modular" and easier to build off of.
* If you find yourself repeating code, think about how you could use either a loop or a new function to eliminate the repitition.
